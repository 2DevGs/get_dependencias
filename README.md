## _GetX Dependency Management_

In this project, I used basic structures to make dependency management as clear as possible. 
But at the same time, making it clear what each control is managing.

The following packages were used:
- GetX
- SharedPreferences

## NOTES

```dart
sdk: ">=2.17.6 <3.0.0"
flutter: 3.0.5
get: ^4.6.5
shared_preferences: ^2.1.1
```

## Tech

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Visual Studio Code is a source code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux, and macOS. It includes support for debugging, built-in Git version control, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring. It is customizable, allowing users to change the editor's theme, shortcut keys, and preferences. It is free and open-source software, although the official download is under a proprietary license.
